  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <clkps2> is placed at site <V12>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <clkps2_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y12>. There is
   only a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer,
   and they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists
   and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <clkps2.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

Section 3 - Informational

   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 28 IOs, 24 are locked
   and 4 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
